basic videogame compiled on c# to pratice variables an other simple functions.

For some reason Windows detect my tille console game as a trojan, for that reason in order to download the game you need to deactivate real time proteccion, and when you have it enable it again, DO NOT FORGET TO ENABLE YOU'RE REAL TIME PROTECCION AFTER THE DONWLOAD.
If windows keeps telling you the dll is blocked, just make and exception, you can check program.cs to see there's nothing malicious in it.
